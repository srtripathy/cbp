This is a repo for an app created entirely by OpenAI Codex in python to help schedule and track weekly badminton games for a club of about 16 players.  
So each week on Wednesday a fresh sheet must be created with player names and ticked if playing a game.  
About 16 games could be played every Wednesday.

The sheet is created at the start of the games and updated as games are played. 

An admin person will handle this app preferably on a mobile phone using a URL so the app is hosted
on the Render platform.
